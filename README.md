# Mileage-Predictor
This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the mileage (MPG) of a vehicle based on engine size, cylinders, transmission type, drive type, fuel type, and highway mileage. It uses a hybrid machine learning model (Linear Regression + Random Forest) for accurate predictions.
